I was interested in this data because I wanted to see how my favorite artists were doing on spotify. I was wondering if they were as popular as I thought they were. I wanted to know if the artists I were listening to were more underrated or more overrated than I thought. I tend to listen to more underrated music and would enjoy knowing where they rank on spotify.

I hope to answer (10 questions)
1. How many streams my favorite artists have
2. What their ranking is amongst other popular artists
3. What rank is Rex Orange County
4. What rank is Tame Impala
5. What rank is Laufey
6. What rank is Steve Lacy
7. What rank is grantperez
8. What rank is Olivia Rodrigo
9. What rank is Bruno Major
10. What rank is When in Rome
